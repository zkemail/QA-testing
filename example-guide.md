## QA Testing

### 1. Footer Alignment Issue (Frontend)
[Take a screenshot]

> âœ… Submit complete screenshot with console open on the side and the Browser icon visible in the tab bar below. (For mobile devices, the bottom tab and console won't be visible, so ignore in that case)

The footer is weirdly placed in the center of the screen

> âœ… If there's a problem in part of a UI, we also recommend including an individual image of that UI. It helps us pinpoint the problem and set the context.

### 2. Hidden Images Issue (Email Template)
[Screenshot 3]

> âœ… **When sharing a complete screen isn't appropriate**
>
> If you're using a mail client, it's better to just post the image of the email. This way, you can keep your personal space private.

> â›” **Complete context not provided**
>
> There's an obvious problem in the above issue: it doesn't specify the email client being used (Gmail/Hotmail/Apple Mail)
